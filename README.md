### Performace Boosting features

-Lazy Loading:

I have implemented lazy loading to enhance performance by dynamically loading resources only when needed. This ensures a faster initial load time and smoother user experience, especially for content-heavy applications.

Our application is SEO optimized to ensure maximum visibility and discoverability on search engines. I have added meta tags and structured data markup to enhance search engine indexing and ranking.

According to Lighthouse, a tool that measures web app accessibility, SEO, best practices, and performance, and the application scores a perfect 100% across the board for the first three. Additionally, the performance score exceeds 80%.
